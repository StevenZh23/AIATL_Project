Based on the patient's medical history and the reported symptoms, there are several possible diagnoses:

1. **Migraine with Aura:** The patient's history of migraines and the visual hallucinations could be consistent with a migraine with aura. However, the intensity of the headache and the fear of being attacked are not typical for a migraine. 
2. **Panic Attack:** The patient's history of anxiety disorder and the sudden onset of fear, visual hallucinations, and intense headache could be indicative of a panic attack. 
3. **Delirium:** The patient's symptoms of confusion, hallucinations, and fear could also suggest delirium, a sudden state of confusion that can be caused by various underlying medical conditions.
4. **Neurological Event:** It is also possible that the patient is experiencing a neurological event, such as a stroke, seizure, or transient ischemic attack (TIA). 

**Recommendations:** The patient should seek immediate medical attention. A doctor can perform a thorough physical exam, assess their mental status, and order necessary tests to rule out serious medical conditions.
