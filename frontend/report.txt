Neurologist. George, based on your recent symptoms and medical history, the diagnosis is Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs). TIAs are like mini-strokes, caused by a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. They can be a sign of underlying health conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes.  The neurologist will need to perform a thorough assessment to determine the cause of your TIAs and help you manage any risk factors. This might involve tests like an MRI or CT scan to look for any blockages in your blood vessels. It's also important to see a cardiologist, as TIAs can be a warning sign of a more serious stroke. The cardiologist will evaluate your cardiovascular health and help you create a plan to manage your risk factors. Remember, with proper treatment and management, you can reduce your risk of future TIAs and strokes.
