Neurologist.  Lindsay, based on your description of  "My head hurts like crazy and it feels like it's going to jump out of my head. I see the trees around me walking and I feel like they are going to run at me and eat me," it sounds like you might be experiencing something called a migraine with aura. This means you are experiencing visual disturbances, such as seeing things that aren't there, along with a severe headache. These symptoms can be very scary and overwhelming, and it's important to get help right away. 

It's also possible that you might be experiencing a stroke, which is a medical emergency. Symptoms of a stroke can include sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking; sudden vision problems in one or both eyes; sudden dizziness or loss of balance; and sudden severe headache. 

The neurologist will be able to do a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment. It's important to remember that strokes are more common in certain ethnicities and genders, so it's crucial for the neurologist to take your race and gender into account when making a diagnosis.
