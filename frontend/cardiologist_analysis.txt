** The patient's symptoms are concerning and require immediate medical attention. It is impossible to provide a definitive diagnosis without a comprehensive physical examination and further investigation.  

Possible diagnoses include:

* **Migraine with Aura:** The patient's history of migraines, combined with the visual hallucinations, suggests a potential migraine with aura. However, the fear and intense headache are atypical for a typical migraine. 
* **Delirium:** The patient's symptoms of confusion, hallucinations, and fear could be indicative of delirium, a sudden state of confusion that can be caused by various underlying medical conditions.
* **Neurological Event:** The visual hallucinations and fear could be signs of a neurological event, such as a stroke, seizure, or transient ischemic attack (TIA). 
* **Psychiatric Condition:** The patient's symptoms, particularly the fear of being attacked, could indicate a psychiatric condition such as a panic attack, anxiety disorder, or psychosis. 

**Recommendations:** 
The patient should seek immediate medical attention.  A doctor can perform a thorough physical exam, assess their mental status, and order necessary tests to rule out serious medical conditions.
