This patient presents with a complex constellation of symptoms, making a definitive diagnosis challenging without further investigation. Based on the information provided, here are some potential diagnoses with their rationale:

1. **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs):** The patient's symptoms of memory lapses, speech disturbances, dizziness, lightheadedness, and confusion align with the classic presentation of TIAs. These are brief episodes of neurological dysfunction caused by temporary blood flow restriction to the brain. The patient's history of hypertension and family history of stroke further support this possibility. 
2. **Anxiety-related Symptoms:** The patient's history of anxiety disorder suggests that their symptoms could be related to anxiety-induced panic attacks or hyperventilation.  Panic attacks can cause similar symptoms to TIAs, including dizziness, lightheadedness, and confusion. 
3. **Migraine Aura:** While not a direct match, migraine aura can sometimes present with transient neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances and speech problems.  The patient's history of migraines warrants consideration.
4. **Other Neurological Conditions:**  While less likely, other neurological conditions such as epilepsy or a brain tumor could potentially cause these symptoms. However, the lack of other neurological signs, like seizures or changes in vision, makes these diagnoses less probable.

**Uncertainties:** 

1. **Severity and Frequency:** It's crucial to understand the true severity of the memory lapses and speech disturbances.  Are they impacting daily life? Do they significantly impair the patient's ability to communicate or function?
2. **Underlying Cause:** Determining the underlying cause of the symptoms is paramount. TIAs require urgent evaluation to prevent stroke, while anxiety-related symptoms may need a different approach. 
3. **Medical History:** A comprehensive review of the patient's medical history, including medication history, is essential to rule out any potential drug interactions or adverse effects that could contribute to the symptoms.

**Recommendations:**  
* A thorough neurological examination is necessary to assess the patient's cognitive function, reflexes, and coordination.
* Electroencephalogram (EEG) to rule out seizure activity.
*  Brain imaging, such as a CT scan or MRI, may be needed to rule out structural abnormalities. 
* Cardiovascular evaluation to assess the patient's risk of stroke and manage their hypertension.
*  Psychiatric evaluation to address the patient's anxiety and consider potential anxiety-related interventions. 

**Next Steps:**
* I will discuss these potential diagnoses and recommendations with the patient to formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. 
* I will arrange for the necessary diagnostic testing and follow-up appointments. 
*  I will collaborate with other healthcare professionals, such as neurologists and psychiatrists, as needed.
