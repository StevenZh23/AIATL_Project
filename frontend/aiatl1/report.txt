Neurologist.  Robert, based on your recent symptoms, including memory lapses and speech difficulties, we are considering the possibility of a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), which is a mini-stroke.  While TIA is a common consideration, it's important to note that males of Chinese descent may experience less typical symptoms.  This means you might experience memory loss or speech problems without the typical weakness or numbness.  We need to evaluate the frequency, duration, and triggers of your memory lapses and speech disturbances to determine if this is the case. We'll also discuss your experience with healthcare access to understand any potential cultural factors that might affect your care.
