Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, there are several possible diagnoses:

1. **Panic Attack:** The patient's history of anxiety disorder, the sudden onset of fear, visual hallucinations, and intense headache are consistent with a panic attack. The patient's history of sleep apnea and variable CPAP compliance may also contribute to the symptoms.
2. **Migraine with Aura:**  The patient's history of migraines and the visual hallucinations could be consistent with a migraine with aura. However, the intensity of the headache and the fear of being attacked are not typical for a migraine. 
3. **Neurological Event:** The patient's symptoms, including the intense headache, visual hallucinations, and fear, could also suggest a neurological event such as a stroke, seizure, or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The duration of the symptoms and the frequency of the episodes raise concerns about this possibility.

**Recommendations:**  Due to the severity and potential seriousness of the symptoms, the patient should seek immediate medical attention. A doctor can perform a thorough physical exam, assess their mental status, and order necessary tests to rule out serious medical conditions.
