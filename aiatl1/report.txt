Lila, after carefully reviewing your medical history, examining your symptoms, and considering the results of your tests, we've reached a diagnosis. 

Based on your chest pain, which worsens with activity and improves with rest, it appears you're experiencing stable or atypical angina. This means that there's a temporary blockage in your coronary arteries, which are the blood vessels supplying your heart.  

However, we also need to consider the higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Korean women, especially at younger ages.  Women often experience atypical angina symptoms, which can be different from the classic crushing chest pain often depicted. 

We've taken into account your family history of CAD, your smoking history, and your potential risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension.  The results of your electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzyme tests, and stress test have also been carefully reviewed. 

While the most likely explanation is stable angina, it's also important to rule out other possibilities, such as microvascular angina.  This condition, more common in women, involves smaller blood vessels that may be constricting or blocked, leading to chest pain. 

To give you a complete picture, we'll need to conduct additional tests. These will help us determine the exact nature of your angina and guide your treatment plan.
