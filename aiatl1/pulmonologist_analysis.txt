- **Stable Angina:** The patient's chest pain, described as "pressure-like" and worsening with activity, improving with rest, aligns with the characteristics of stable angina. Her history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and family history of CAD (father - MI at 62) further supports this diagnosis. 

- **Atypical Angina:** The absence of typical pain radiation, combined with the patient's description of "pressure-like" pain, could indicate atypical angina.  

- **Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD):** The presence of ankle swelling and the absence of pain radiation to the arms or jaw raises concern about PAD. However, given the lack of chest pain history in the medical records, the likelihood of PAD is less significant than stable or atypical angina.

Uncertainties:
- Further investigation is necessary to confirm the presence of any of these diagnoses.
- The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes increases her cardiovascular risk profile.
- The medical records do not include a clear description of the onset, location, and duration of the patient's chest pain, limiting the accuracy of my assessment.  

Recommendations:
- Immediate evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes to rule out acute coronary syndrome.
- Stress testing (e.g., treadmill or nuclear stress test) to assess the severity of coronary artery disease and determine the need for further intervention.
- Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities to assess for PAD, though this is less urgent than the cardiac evaluation given the current data.
- Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, dietary changes, and regular exercise, are crucial for managing cardiovascular risk factors.
- Medications for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia should be reviewed and optimized as needed.
