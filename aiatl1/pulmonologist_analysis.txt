Possible diagnoses for the patient's symptoms of memory lapses and brief speech disturbances include:

* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** The patient's history of hypertension and sleep apnea, both risk factors for stroke, makes TIA a possible diagnosis. The lack of other typical stroke symptoms, such as weakness or paralysis, makes this diagnosis less certain. 
* **Migraine Aura:** The patient's history of migraine headaches suggests that their memory lapses and speech disturbances could be related to migraine aura.  Aura symptoms are typically visual, but they can also affect speech and cognition. 
* **Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's history of anxiety disorder could be contributing to their symptoms. Anxiety can cause memory problems and speech difficulties, especially if the patient is experiencing panic attacks or significant stress. 
* **Medication Side Effects:**  The patient is taking Amlodipine, Propranolol, and Sertraline. Some of these medications, particularly those used to treat hypertension or anxiety, can cause memory lapses or speech disturbances as side effects. 
* **Cognitive Decline:** While less likely given the patient's age and lack of other neurological symptoms, cognitive decline due to conditions like Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia should be considered. 

**Rationale:**

The patient's symptoms, combined with their medical history, point towards a possible neurological event or a condition affecting their brain function.  The history of hypertension and sleep apnea, both risk factors for stroke, makes TIA a strong possibility.  However, the absence of other typical stroke symptoms, like weakness or paralysis, makes this diagnosis less certain. Migraine aura is another possibility, particularly given the patient's history of migraines. The patient's history of anxiety disorder could also explain the symptoms.  The patient's medication list includes medications that could cause memory lapses or speech disturbances as a side effect.

**Uncertainties:**

The severity and frequency of the patient's memory lapses and speech disturbances are important factors to consider. A detailed assessment of these symptoms, including the duration of each episode and any associated neurological signs, would be crucial to narrow down the possible diagnoses.  Further investigation of potential medication side effects is also necessary.  Finally, a comprehensive neurological evaluation may be necessary to rule out other potential causes and determine the most appropriate course of action.
