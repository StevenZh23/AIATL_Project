Based on the patient's reported symptoms of severe chest pain (level 10) and their medical history, the most likely diagnoses are:

1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack):** The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, family history of CAD, and former smoking status put her at high risk for coronary artery disease. The severe chest pain, which is a level 10 and does not improve with rest, is highly suggestive of a heart attack.

2. **Unstable Angina:** While the severity and duration of the pain suggest a more serious event, it's possible that this could be a severe episode of unstable angina. Unstable angina is characterized by chest pain that is more severe, frequent, or occurs at rest. 

3. **Acute Pericarditis:**  Pericarditis is an inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart and can cause chest pain. It's less likely given the patient's history and risk factors, but should be considered.

**Uncertainties:** 

* **The exact nature of the chest pain:** The description of the pain as "pressure-like" could be consistent with both angina and a heart attack. More information about the location, radiation, and quality of the pain is needed for a definitive diagnosis.
* **Other contributing factors:** The patient's medical history suggests other potential contributors to chest pain, such as heart failure or pulmonary embolism. Further investigation is needed to rule out these possibilities.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Immediate medical attention:** This patient needs to be evaluated immediately in a hospital setting. 
* **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** An ECG is essential to assess for signs of a heart attack or other cardiac abnormalities.
* **Cardiac enzymes:** Blood tests to assess for biomarkers indicating damage to the heart muscle.
* **Chest X-ray:**  To rule out other potential causes of chest pain, such as pneumonia or pneumothorax.
* **Echocardiogram:** To assess the heart's structure and function, and to rule out heart failure or other cardiac abnormalities.
