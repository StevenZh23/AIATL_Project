Lola, based on your symptoms, medical history, and the results of the tests we've conducted, I need to discuss some serious possibilities with you. 

Firstly, your history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, family history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and former smoking status all increase your risk for heart disease.  These factors make you particularly susceptible to what we call **Acute Myocardial Infarction**, which is a heart attack.

However, the severity and duration of your pain could also be consistent with **Unstable Angina**, which is chest pain caused by a temporary blockage of blood flow to the heart.

To be absolutely sure, we need to perform a few more tests.  We'll need to do an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check for any abnormalities in your heart rhythm, and some blood tests to measure your cardiac enzymes, which are biomarkers that can indicate damage to your heart muscle. 

Additionally, a chest X-ray will help us rule out any other potential causes of your chest pain, such as pneumonia or a collapsed lung. Finally, an echocardiogram will give us a detailed picture of your heart's structure and function.

Lola, I understand that this is a lot to process, and it's important for you to understand that these are just possibilities at this point. The results of these tests will be crucial in determining a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. We'll discuss the results and your treatment options as soon as we have them. 

I want to assure you that I'm here for you every step of the way, and we'll work together to get you the best possible care.
