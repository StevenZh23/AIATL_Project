Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the following potential diagnoses should be considered:

1. **Stable Angina:** The patient's chest pain, described as "pressure-like" and worsening with activity, improving with rest, aligns with the characteristics of stable angina. Her history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and family history of CAD (father - MI at 62) further supports this diagnosis. 

2. **Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD):** The presence of ankle swelling and the absence of pain radiation to the arms or jaw raises concern about PAD. While the patient's chest pain could be primarily due to angina, the ankle swelling suggests potential involvement of peripheral arteries as well. Further evaluation is necessary to rule out PAD or determine its severity.

3. **Atypical Angina:** The absence of typical pain radiation, combined with the patient's description of "pressure-like" pain, could indicate atypical angina.  

Uncertainties:
- Further investigation is necessary to confirm the presence of any of these diagnoses.
- The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes increases her cardiovascular risk profile.

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes to rule out acute coronary syndrome.
- Stress testing (e.g., treadmill or nuclear stress test) to assess the severity of coronary artery disease and determine the need for further intervention.
- Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities to assess for PAD.
- Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, dietary changes, and regular exercise, are crucial for managing cardiovascular risk factors.
- Medications for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia should be reviewed and optimized as needed.
